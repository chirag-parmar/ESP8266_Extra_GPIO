# ESP8266_Extra_GPIO
The circuit along with the code helps to extend the number of GPIO available on the ESP8266. The circuit uses IC 74HC595 which is a shift register. The code is optimized to drive the shift register IC using only two pins, which exactly matches to the number of available GPIO on a ESP8266-01.
